# About this site
As a parent of two kids (now aged 6 and 8), I often look for bedtime stories, but it seems so hard to find when *googling* it!

I would love to have a place to go and choose stories by age, subject, moral of the story and time. So I've created this site.

Have stories to share? Please email me at marcello(dot)uxd(at)gmail(dot)com
